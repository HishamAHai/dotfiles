# Picom
Picom compositior is a fork of compton with some added features that suits my needs.
It allows me to have transparency and blur which I'm a big fan off.\
To be able to enable the blur effect, one has to use the option `--experimental-backends` when launching picom.\
To be able to compile it the `bison` dependency is needed from the `base-devel` group.
