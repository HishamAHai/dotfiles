# i3gaps
`i3-wm` An improved dynamic (not really) tiling window manager, and `i3-gaps` is a fork of i3wm with more features including gaps.\
I started journey of tiling window managers with i3 eventhough I don't use it today since it's really easy to configure for noobs and it will always have a special place in my heart.
