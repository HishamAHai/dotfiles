Awesome window manager is with no doubt the most customizable and configurable WM use can use.It has a great and probably the best documentation and the selling point (figuratively) is the widgets system. But it does not stop at this point, since it uses the scripting language =lua=  to write the configuration file, you can extende it to do whatever you want.

The main configuration file of lua is =rc.lua= which has to be located at =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/awesome/rc.lua=. After installing AwesomeWM for the first time, this file has to be copied from =/etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua=, and the other important file is the theme configuration file which has to be located at =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/awesome/themes/theme.lua=.

My way of configuring AwesomeWM is by splitting the configuration into separte modules, each module is resposible for a certain function, to make it easier for trubleshooting and implementing new modules. My =rc.lua= has calls for each module being used.
** Missing Modules directory
This directory contains two github projects to expand the functionality of AwesomeWm. In order to add them, first create a new directory inside awesome directory called modules =mkdir modules && cd modules= and then clone the following repository =git clone https://github.com/BlingCorp/bling.git=
** Important notes
- Note 1: keep in mind that the =Right alt= key works only for the *Spanish keyboard layout*. For other layouts you should assign a different key.
- Note 2: I personally use =kitty terminal= since it's gpu accelerated and has a better Arabic support than others like =alacritty=.
- Note 3: You can get a list of all keybindings in AwesomeWM by pressing =Super + s=.

| =Super + Shift + c=  | Close any open window     |
| =Super + Shift + r=  | restart AwesomeWM         |
| =Super + Shift + q=  | kill AwesomeWM            |
